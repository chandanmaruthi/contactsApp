,"Closed Questions

,"Face the speaker and maintain eye contact.
Talking to someone while they scan the room, study a computer screen, or gaze out the window is like trying to hit a moving target.

,"Opening - Your opening should be something that makes an emotional connection with the audience.  It can be a story, a question, or a shocking static.

,"Body - Try to stick to your three most important points. It's more important to engage the audience than to tell them everything you know. You will need to leave some information out, but it is likely that what you don't cover in the presentation will come up when you take questions. Keep your outcome in mind. You don't have to write out your presentation word for word (or worse, memorize it) if you just remember to keep going back to your main points and working toward your desired outcome. Be prepared to present both sides of an issue. ",#Presentation_Skills                ,How many points do you want to make in your presentation,A few – 3 use a good number,"As many as you like, 8-10, 1 point , Does not matter"

,"Practice, practice, practice…but don't memorize. 'It's different for everybody, but I will say one thing: If you practice your speech only once, you're going to stink,' Braithwaite says.

",#Presentation_Skills                ,Why should you not try to memorize,Lots of things change during the actual presentation you cant control,"It actually helps to memorize, Not sure"
,"Rehearsing does not mean memorization - Memorizing your speech can make you sound mechanical and over-rehearsed. 'Really the only people who are good at memorizing things are actors,' Braithwaite says.

Take a couple of days to relax before your speech",#Presentation_Skills                ,Why is it important to stop working on the presentation before you are delivering it,It helps calm your nerves and be relaxed,"It does not help, Not sure"

,"Telling your story is not like writing an essay as you were taught in school. Don’t mention what is to be said, then say it, then recap. With the traditional method of setting out the content of what is to be mentioned the story is over before you’ve started, there is no drama, you know how it is going to end. ",#Storytelling                       ,What is the big difference between a story and a presentation,You dont tell the outcome upfront,"Its the same, Not sure"
,"Instead create an anecdote that builds the story, event by event as it happened.  Ideally a great story will have a variation on these elements:

Beginning – sets the stage
Body – starts and builds the story
Sequence of events – helps to create a story
Bait – Constantly raising questions(where is this going?) and answering them in a reflective way
Climax – story builds to a high point
Resolution – the punch line results in the reflection on the story",#Storytelling                       ,Does it help to think about a structure to a story,"Yes, It helps improve the success the ods of the story helping you communicate","It does not, Just make it fun"
